        	<b>The white shark is found in the surface coastal and open waters of all the Earth's oceans (except the Arctic). It is one of the largest predatory fish on Earth. It has a lifespan of approximately 70 years and is believed to be the most dangerous shark species to humans, with the great white shark attributed to most attacks on humans.
        It is on the verge of extinction - there are about 3500 individuals on Earth.</b>
